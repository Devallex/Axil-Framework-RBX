This has been archived because I no longer use Roblox.

# Overview

Axil-Framework is starting point for creating an object-oriented Roblox game.

## What is it's purpose?
- A cleaner way to structure a game project.
- OOP with easy inheritance to make code more reusable.
- Better synchronous broadcasting of messages with the [Emitter](docs/Classes/Emitter.md) class.
- Better communication between the client and server with the [Replicator](docs/Classes/Replicator.md) class.
  - Built in client-server replication, copy classes to the client.
  - Events built into classes.
- Easier way to access other scripts with the [Resource Module](docs/Modules/ResourceModule.md).

It uses [Rojo](https://rojo.space) (or any other similar program) to synchronize code from the filesystem to the Roblox project.
Use [HotSwap](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/hotswap-plugin-speed-up-plugin-development/10310) to run plugins.
